# Hello there!

Hello! Iâ€™m George, a PhD student researcher at the [University of Birmingham](cs.bham.ac.uk), under the supervision of [Dan Ghica](cs.bham.ac.uk/~drg) and [Miriam Backens](cs.bham.ac.uk/~backensm/)! I am a member of the [Theory Group](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/).

My research involves diagrammatic languages for categories and graph rewriting using hypergraphs.

I also make silly discord bots and train related things.
