# Hello!

Iâ€™m George, a PhD student at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dan Ghica](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~drg/) and [Miriam Backens](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~backensm/)! 
I am a member of the [Theory Group](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/computer-science/theory-of-computation).

My research involves combinatorial diagrammatic languages for monoidal categories using hypergraphs, in order to use them as an operational semantics using graph rewrites.

I also make silly discord bots and train related things.
